Yes! Note, however, that Neuroscout is a web-based engine for fMRI analysis specification; at the moment, we don't provide free computing resources for the execution of the resulting analysis bundles. I plan to publish results I've obtained using Neuroscout, how do I cite? After you generate an analysis, a \"Bibliography\" tab will be shown which will auto-generate a reference list for the dataset, feature extractors, and scientific software used for that analysis. In addition to these references, be sure to include the unique analysis ID associated with any results. Are there any restrictions on analyses I've created? Yes. By using Neuroscout, you agree that once you have finalized and \"compiled\" an analysis, the analysis can no longer be deleted from our system. If you wish to 'edit' an Analysis, you may clone the analysis, and make any desired changed on the forked version. Although analyses are by default not searchable by other users, any user with the private analysis ID may view your analysis. Also, in the event that you publish any results generated using the NeuroScout interface, you MUST provide a link to the corresponding analysis page(s) on the NeuroScout website. I have a naturalistic study I'd like to share on Neuroscout, how do I do so? Due to the financial cost of extracting features from multi-modal stimuli using external APIs, the set of datasets we support is manually curated. However, we are continually expanding the list of supported datasets, and we encourage researchers to contact us if they want to make their data available for use in Neuroscout. Note that it is much easier for us to ingest datasets that are already deposited in the OpenNeuro repository, and we we strongly recommend uploading your dataset to OpenNeuro whether or not it eventually ends up in Neuroscout. I want to make changes to an analysis I already ran, but it is locked. How can I edit it? Once an analysis has been run, it is permanently locked and archived for provenance. You may \"clone\" your analysis, and make changes to this new copy of your analysis. I want to make one of my \"private\" analyses public, but the website says the analysis is \"locked\"! When an analysis is locked, you can no longer make any substantive changes that affect model specification. However, you can always edit the name, description, and public/private status. So go ahead and make your analysis public! How do you automatically extract features from naturalistic datasets? The original stimuli presented to users are submitted to various machine learning algorithms and services to extract novel feature timecourses. To facility this process, we have developed a Python library for multimodal feature extraction called pliers. Pliers allows us to extract a wide-variety of features across modalities using various external content analysis services with ease. For example, we are able to use Google Vision API to encode various aspects of the visual elements of movie frames, such as when a face is present. In addition, pliers allows us to easily link up various feature extraction services; for example, we can use the IBM Watson Speech to Text API to transcribe the speech in a movie into words with precise onsets, and then use a predefined dictionary of lexical norms to extract lexical norms for each word, such as frequency. We can then generate timecourses for each of these extracted features, creating novel predictors of brain activity. For more information of pliers, please see the GitHub repository and the following paper: McNamara, Q., De La Vega, A., & Yarkoni, T. (2017, August). Developing a comprehensive framework for multimodal feature extraction. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 1567-1574). ACM. Am I restricted to mass univariate GLMs, or can I use Neuroscout to specify other kinds of analyses? Currently, that is the case. However,the underlying BIDS-StatsModel is designed with more complex models in mind, such as predictive and linear-mixed effect models Can I contribute my own predictors to Neuroscout? Yes! Using the \"My Predictors\" function, you can create custom collections of predictors to add to your analyses. Simply navigate to My Predictors , and click on \"Add New Predictors\". Features should be in BIDS-compliant events format. Two columns are mandatory: \"onset\" and \"duration\" (both in seconds). You can then include any number of novel predictors as additional columns. Missing values can be annotated using the value \"n/a\" (no quotes). For each events file that you upload, you will be asked to associate it with runs in the respective dataset. Typically, there will be a different event file for each run in a naturalistic dataset. You must then associate each file with subjects. For example, in most cases, all subjects will have seen the same stimulus, but this will vary across datasets. After uploading, a new collection of predictors will be created. By default, predictors in this collection will be private, and only visible to you in the Analysis Builder. If you wish to share these predictors with other Neuroscout users, please contact us, and we can make your predictors public.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#is-this-service-free-to-use","text":"Yes!

The top plot will give you an overview of the design matrix, with each column of the design matrix on the x-axis and time on the y-axis. In the bottom plot, you can explore the predictor time courses in more detail. By clicking on the legend on the right, you can select specific predictors to plot. You may shift-click to select multiple predictors at once. Note For display purposes, each column is standardized prior to the creation of these plots, even if you did not request a scale transformation. This force re-scaling will not be performed when creating the actual design matrix. Correlation Matrix The correlation matrix provides you can opportunity to review the covariance between your predictors. Note that predictors that are highlight correlated with each other may result in a rank deficient design matrix which will cause model fitting to fail. Hint Hover over values in the plot to see the correlation r-values. Analysis Overview Finally, a complete summary of your analysis is displayed in this tab. Here you can review all of the choices you've made and ensure you are happy with the analysis prior to continuing. Note Neuroscout stores your model design using BIDS Stats-Model, an in-development JSON standard for representing fMRI models. This is the true, final representation of your model, so if you are having problems, or would like to meticulously review your analysis, review this section.","title":"Review"},{"location":"builder/review/#review","text":"Once you have selected predictors, applied transformations, and defined your contrasts, you're ready to review the statistical model you've designed.","title":"Review"},{"location":"builder/review/#design-report","text":"Upon reaching the Review tab, a report is requested from the Neuroscout server that will validate your analysis, apply transformations and pre-compute the design matrix to be fit to the fMRI data.

This step is optional-- for many models you may not need to make any modifications to the input variables. To add a transformation, click Add Transformation and select an operation from the dropdown list. The transformations currently supported by Neuroscout are a subset of the complete set of transformations detailed in the BIDS StatsModel specification (in active development). As Neuroscout matures, the number of support transformations will grow. Transformation Description Scale Standardize the value of one or more variables. Can independently choose to denmean and/or rescale. Orthogonalize Orthogonalizes one or more input columns with respect to one or more other columns. Select input For all transformation, you must select on which this transformation will operate. Most operations will operate on each column independently, but specifying multiple columns will save you from having to specify the same operation for multiple predictors. Transformation-specific options Most transformations additional have specific options which you can specify. Scale Demean - If True, subtracts the mean from each input column (i.e., applies mean-centering). Rescale - If True, divides each column by its standard deviation. ReplaceNA - Whether/when to replace missing values with 0. \"Don't replace\"- no replacement is performed. If 'before', missing values are replaced with 0's before scaling. If 'after', missing values are replaced with 0 after scaling. Orthogonalize You must select the inputs to orthogonalize with respect to. The transformed variable will be uncorrelated to these variables. Threshold Threshold - The value to binarize around (values above will be assigned 1, values below will be assigned 0) Binarize - If True, binarizes all non-zero values (i.e., every non-zero value will be set to 1). Above - Specifies which values to retain with respect to the cut-off. If True, all value above the threshold will be kept; if False, all values below the threshold will be kept. Signed - Specifies whether to treat the threshold as signed (default) or unsigned. For example, when passing above=True and threshold=3, if signed=True, all and only values above +3 would be retained. If signed=False, all absolute values > 3 would be retained (i.e.,values in the range -3 < X < 3 would be set to 0). Editing and order It is important to note that transformations are applied sequentially, so the order of the transformation matters. To re-order transformation you can drag and drop transformations in the list. You can also remove transformations you've created using the trash icon, and edit existing transformations with the blue edit icon.","title":"Transformations"},{"location":"builder/transformations/#add-transformations","text":"The next step in defining model is to transform the variables you've selected.
