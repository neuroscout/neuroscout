# Bibliography

The bibliography tab will become available once an analysis has been submitted.

Here, we summarize all the relevant references for the tools, data, and extractors used in an analysis.

Be sure to cite these references if you publish any results stemming from this analysis.

## Export All

If you wish to export these citations into a bibliography manager, we currently offer two formats:

 - HTML - APA: An array of strings with APA formatted references.
 - CSL - JSON: A complete specification of these reference in [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/). This format is importable into many reference managers, such as Mendeley.
